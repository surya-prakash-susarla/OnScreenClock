# Floating Clock — Feature Requests

## 1. Scale up sizes + continuous scaling
- Current sizes are too small (current "large" should be "small")
- Scale up all presets significantly
- Replace discrete small/medium/large with a continuous scale (step 0.5)
- Show + on the right and - on the left of the clock to adjust size
- Persist scale value in config

## 2. Add red + hue picker for foreground color
- Add Red as a preset foreground color option
- Add a horizontal bar-style hue picker for arbitrary foreground color selection

## 3. Countdown timer
- HH:MM:SS input for setting the timer duration
- Controls in the menu bar: Start, Pause, Reset
- When timer is active, the clock display shows the countdown

## 4. Fix text alignment
- The time text appears misaligned within the rounded rect boundary
- Center it properly both vertically and horizontally

## 5. Show current time as sub-text when timer is active
- When countdown timer is running, show the actual current time as small text below the timer
- Depends on #3

## 6. Seconds toggle
- Menu bar option to show/hide seconds (HH:MM vs HH:MM:SS)
- Persist the setting in config
